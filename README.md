## WASTE TO ENERGY WITH EMPHASIS ON ORGANIC WASTE

## Objectives of this Project
• To collect the current situation of organic waste collection in the study area.
• To study about the ways to solve major environmental issues namely pollution caused due to 
organic waste accumulation.
• To find proper methods to reduce the organic wastes by converting waste to energy, it 
considerably reduces the amount of waste entering landfills, which can save valuable land

## In Brief:
Due to unmanaged solid waste, there is huge increase in air pollution, water pollution and land 
pollution and it also cause many diseases 
Thus, to control this solid waste as well as to get benefit from this, a new concept known as 
waste to energy is introduced with the help of which we can be able to reduce the solid wastes
